# Data driven subclassification of ANCA associated vasculitis – model-based clustering of a federated international cohort
This is the repository containing the code for the statistical analysis in the paper: Data driven subclassification of ANCA associated vasculitis – model-based clustering of a federated international cohort.

[FAIRVASC](https://fairvasc.eu/) (Findable, Interoperable, Accessible, Reusable Vasculitis) is a research project of the European Vasculitis Society (EUVAS) and RITA European Reference Network, bringing together leading scientists, clinicians and patient organisations. The FAIRVASC consortium is made up of 10 partners, including several patient registries in AAV. In 2023, the to-date largest cohort in AAV was [presented](https://doi.org/10.1136/ard-2023-224571) by the FAIRVASC consortium. Retrospective observational data from six European registries were quality controlled and harmonised to a common schema.

To further explore the phenotypic spectrum of AAV, we here perform an unbiased data-driven subclassification of AAV using model-based clustering, utilising this large, harmonised cohort of real-world patient data. This is the code for this analysis.
